# E-Commerce-project
First ever project

Starting web development actually started a while back but not being consistent, I was in tutorial hell but from now onwards going to focus on project base learning and this will be my first project ever.
I hope I will get to learn and understand HTMl, CSS and JS from basic by doing this project, focus is on being consistent with this project and not being perfect in every aspect but to understand basic concepts properly and slowly move forward as I understand things and implement them neatly
